<!-- # Webserv-42

The 42 Webserv project is a milestone in the 42 curriculum.

The main idea: to build their own HTTP/1.1 web server from scratch using C++.

The goal: to understand the inner workings of how the internet handles requests and responses without relying on high-level libraries or frameworks like Nginx or Apache.

Core Objectives:

1 - I/O Multiplexing: Using functions like select(), poll(), or epoll() to handle multiple client connections simultaneously on a single thread without blocking.

2 - The HTTP Protocol: Implementing the parsing and execution of HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE) and returning appropriate status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

3 - CGI (Common Gateway Interface): Enabling the server to execute external scripts (like Python or PHP) to handle dynamic content. -->
