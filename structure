/*src/config/ (Partner B's Home)
This is where the logic for reading webserv.conf lives.

Config.cpp: The main parser.

ServerBlock.cpp: Data container for one server {} block.

LocationBlock.cpp: Data container for one location {} block.

src/server/ (Partner A's Home)
This handles the "plumbing" of the network.

Webserv.cpp: The main loop that manages the pollfd vector and calls poll().

TcpListener.cpp: Handles socket(), bind(), and listen().

Client.cpp: Represents a single connected user. It should store that user's specific pollfd, their raw request buffer, and their pending response.

src/http/ (Joint Effort)
This is the "brain" that connects the config to the network.

HttpRequest.cpp: Logic to turn a raw string into a method, path, and headers.

HttpResponse.cpp: Logic to generate the string HTTP/1.1 200 OK....

MimeTypes.cpp: A small utility to map .jpg to image/jpeg so the browser knows what it's receiving.

src/utils/
Helpful functions that don't belong to a class.

Logger.cpp: For printing colored timestamps to the terminal (makes debugging much easier!).

StringUtils.cpp: For trim(), split(), or converting int to string (since C++98 doesn't have std::to_string).
